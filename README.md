# ML Algorithms over SMPC

This repository contains the implementation of Machine Learning algorithms over two SMPC frameworks:

- SCALE-MAMBA
- MP-SPDZ

These implementations can be seen here. The repository also contains versions of both frameworks, and a Dockerfile to deploy a Docker image containing both of them. The `docker-compose.yml` file allows to create a container running both frameworks simultaneously, with the implemented algorithms added.
